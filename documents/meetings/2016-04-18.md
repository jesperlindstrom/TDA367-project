## Meeting Agenda
* Discuss interaction code
* Discuss GUI menu code

## 1. Objectives (5 min).
We have implemented most basic features, such as physics (collision, movement) and easily creating new entities, that are loaded from JSON files per scene. There are no major coding issues right now, but the report and SDD are of high priority at this point.

## 2. Reports (15 min) from previous meeting
* **All together:** physics, gravity, movement. Controller/model restructuring.
* **Jesper:** Trampoline entity, abstract classes for model, view. Animation system. Debugger for collision.
* **Simon:** Progress on menu and GUI system. Position debugger.
* **Felix:** Mostly physics.
* Samuel is absent.

## 3. Discussion items (35 min) 
* We need to decide how to structure the interaction code.
* We need to decide how to structure the GUI code.

## 4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min) 
### Outcomes
* We decide to discuss and decide on the interaction code on the workshop.
* We decide to discuss and decide on the GUI code on the workshop.

### Assignments
* **All together:** Report. 
* **Jesper:** Rewrite functional requirements in the RAD, as per the mentor feedback. Write report disposition and purpose.
